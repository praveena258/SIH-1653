## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
1. AI-Powered Skill Matchmaking
Description: Use AI algorithms to assess the skills and qualifications of applicants in real-time based on their resumes or profiles. Match applicants to the most relevant job openings, providing employers with recommendations of the best-fit candidates.
Feature: Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze resumes, cover letters, and job descriptions. The AI can also suggest skills improvement areas for applicants based on trends in job requirements.
2. Virtual Interview Simulation with AI Feedback
Description: Create an interactive simulation where applicants can participate in virtual interviews. AI analyzes applicants' responses, tone, and body language (via webcam) to provide feedback on how they can improve their interviewing skills.
Feature: Use machine learning to detect speech patterns, facial expressions, and even the applicant's nervousness levels, offering detailed insights into their performance.
3. Applicant Decision Tree Simulator
Description: Use a decision tree model to simulate a recruitment process where applicants can see potential career paths based on the choices they make during the application process (e.g., choosing a different role or skill set).
Feature: As applicants make choices, the system can dynamically adapt and show them alternate job positions or career paths based on data-driven projections.
4. Real-Time Feedback Dashboard for Applicants
Description: After completing a simulation or applying for a job, applicants are presented with a real-time feedback dashboard that highlights areas of strength and areas that need improvement (e.g., technical skills, communication, or leadership).
Feature: The dashboard could also include a scoring system for each applicant to show how they compare to others in the same field or industry.
5. Gamified Assessment for Applicant Skills
Description: Implement a gamified simulation where applicants complete tasks and challenges related to the skills required for the job (e.g., problem-solving, technical skills, or teamwork).
Feature: Applicants can earn points or badges based on performance, motivating them to improve and enhancing employer visibility into their capabilities.
